Question 1: (20 Marks)
(a) Form a centered binary mask of size 
255
×
255
255×255 of a disc with:

Inner radius = 50 pixels

Outer radius = 100 pixels

(b) Convert the image of size 
255
×
255
255×255 and apply the mask such that:

The ring of the mask is filled by the image

The other portion is set to black

Question 2: (20 Marks)
(a) Write a program to generate a bit-plane image of an image.

(b) Take the generated bit-plane image from 2(a) as a binary mask and apply it as an AND mask on the provided image (Color or Grayscale).

Question 3: (30 Marks)
(a) Using an appropriate transform, reduce the contrast of a given image.

Draw the histogram of the original image and the contrast-reduced image.

Use library functions to plot the histogram.

(b) Apply the histogram equalization method on the low-contrast image obtained in 3(a).
